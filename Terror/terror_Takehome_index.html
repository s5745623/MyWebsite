                <p>The timeline can be drag by each year which is also done by Plotly function slider. The circle represents the number of death. 
                Also the when hover the point, will show the country, attack type, target type, and the death count.</p>
                <p>Terror attack start become active around the mid 70s, which took place all around the world and unpredictable.
                Interestingly, Australia is the continent which had the least terror attack.</p>
                <p>The size of the bubble stands for the number of death of the terrorism attack with the death number larger and equals to 1.</p>

                <p>The heat map like map show higher population density. With most of the terrorism activities mostly occured in high population density area. Except Hawaii only occured once while having a high population density.</p>
