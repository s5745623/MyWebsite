were estimated to be between $20,000-$25,000.","nan","The bombs detonated 30 seconds apart.  The bombs used in the attack were similar to the devices used in the attack against a police station in San Francisco three days later (197002160001).  There was a contentious City Council debate earlier in the week as to whether the police department should receive a helicopter.","nan","nan","nan","This attack is linked with 197002160001.  The sniper and his companion were described as hippie types.","The dynamite was found a day after 197002160001, 197002160002, and 197002160003.  Police reported that the target was apparently random and could not confirm whether this was connected to the previous attacks.","This was one of many incidents of violence directed again police departments in Northern California at this time (197002130003 and 197002160001).","When the bomb was discovered the barracks were evacuated.  This incident might be related with 197003040002.  They both occurred on the same day in a distance of around thirty miles from each other.  However, different types of explosive devices were used.","nan","nan","The Molotov cocktail was thrown through the window of the office.","McKay and Glatkowski hijacked the ship by detaining the captain with their handguns and claiming that there was a bomb on board.  The device turned out to be fake.  Glatkowski would eventually return to the United States and was sentenced to a ten year prison sentence.  McKay would never return to the United States and his whereabouts remain unknown.  This was the first mutiny in the United States Navy in 150 years.  The ship was eventually returned to the United States with all of its cargo.","At the time of the firebombing Norris Gregory was facing a recall election.","There were three other incidents also protesting the quality of education at Roosevelt High School (197004080003, 197004150004, and 197004150005).  Moreover, the school was the target of many demonstrations during this time period.

The letters were postmarked from Las Vegas, Nevada with no return addresses and were placed in white envelopes with razor blades inside.  Not all of the letters were confirmed.  The Justice Department is an animal rights group, much like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF).  The group was also active in Canada and England (where it was initially based).  The Justice Department also committed a razor blade campaign in August 1999 against the fur industry.
