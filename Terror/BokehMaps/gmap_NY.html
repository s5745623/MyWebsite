Also destroyed was the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in New York City, which collapsed as a result of the impact and subsequent fire. The building's collapse undoubtedly damaged the foundation of nearby buildings, though the South Tower had already fallen. Businesses located in the North Tower suffered massive economic losses. Air travel was restricted or prevented in the United States for several months following the attacks. Total losses to the United States Airline industry are unknown, but extremely high. Several major United States airlines were nearly bankrupted in the aftermath of the attacks. The attacks had a negative impact on the U.S. and world economy.","The crash resulted in the destruction of an United Airlines Boeing 767 aircraft.
